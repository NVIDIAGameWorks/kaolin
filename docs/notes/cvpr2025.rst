Bring your laptop to this hands-on course from basics to the bleeding edge of 3D research,
powered by a dedicated GPU back end for each user and NVIDIA Kaolin Library, a PyTorch-based toolkit for fast,
GPU-optimized operations and interactive applications on Gaussian splats, meshes, and volumetric data.
This lab will focus on new research allowing interactive physics simulation with contact for 3D Gaussian Splats and meshes,
rendered jointly using latest advances (`3DGUT <https://github.com/nv-tlabs/3dgrut>`_, a CVPR oral) and viewed interactively in a Jupyter notebook.
Complete coding examples are released together with this tutorial, and are supported by Kaolin Library v0.18.0.

            <p>Vismay is a Research Scientist at NVIDIA, working on Kaolin's representation-agnostic physics simulator.
            His focus is to enable interactive simulation of 3D objects in various representations, empowering artists,
            researchers and engineers to easily prototype, animate and simulate their generated or reconstructed 3D assets.
            His research goal is to ensure that simulation tools support a diverse set of interactive physics-based phenomena,
            including elasto-dynamics, muscle activation, joints, cloth, collisions with frictional contact, on any 3D representation,
            including NeRFs, 3D Gaussian splats, CT scans and more.</p>
