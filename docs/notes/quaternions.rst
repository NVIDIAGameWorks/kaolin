Quaternions in PyTorch
**********************

.. _quaternions:

Quanternions are handy mathematical tools for working with rotations and 3D transformations,
and since v0.16.0 Kaolin Library bundles a module of low-level convenience operations with quaternions,
targeting common use cases and exposing a plain PyTorch interface to all functions.

See :py:mod:`kaolin.math.quat` documentations for a full list of functions and a short python recipe in `examples/recipes/quat/quat_transforms.py <https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin/blob/master/examples/recipes/quat/quat_transforms.py>`_.
