Welcome to Kaolin Library Documentation
=======================================

`NVIDIA Kaolin library <https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin>`_ provides a PyTorch API for working with a variety of 3D representations and includes a growing collection of GPU-optimized operations such as modular differentiable rendering, fast conversions between representations, data loading, 3D checkpoints, differentiable camera API, differentiable lighting with spherical harmonics and spherical gaussians, powerful octree acceleration structure called Structured Point Clouds, interactive 3D visualizer for jupyter notebooks, convenient batched mesh container, quaternion operations, representation-agnostic physics simulation and more.
See :ref:`Installation <installation>`, :ref:`API Overview <overview>` and :ref:`Tutorials <tutorial_index>` to get started!
