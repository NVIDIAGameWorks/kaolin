Welcome to Kaolin's documentation!
==================================

NVIDIA Kaolin library provides a PyTorch API for working with a variety of 3D representations and includes a growing collection of GPU-optimized operations such as modular differentiable rendering, fast conversions between representations, data loading, 3D checkpoints and more.

Kaolin library is part of a larger suite of tools for 3D deep learning research. For example, NVIDIA Omniverse Kaolin app (coming soon!) will allow interactive visualization of 3D checkpoints. To find out more about the Kaolin ecosystem, visit the `NVIDIA Kaolin Dev Zone page <https://developer.nvidia.com/kaolin>`_.
