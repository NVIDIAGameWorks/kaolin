NVIDIA Kaolin library provides a PyTorch API for working with a variety of 3D representations and includes a growing collection of GPU-optimized operations such as modular differentiable rendering, fast conversions between representations, data loading, 3D checkpoints and more.

Kaolin library is part of a larger suite of tools for 3D deep learning research. For example, `Omniverse Kaolin app <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_kaolin/app_kaolin/overview.html>`_ will allow interactive visualization of 3D checkpoints. To find out more about the Kaolin ecosystem, visit the `NVIDIA Kaolin Dev Zone page <https://developer.nvidia.com/kaolin>`_.
