# DIB-Renderer Example

![example image](example.gif)

This example uses the DIB-R renderer in kaolin to render a simple mesh (using position as vertex colors), and output an animated GIF image of the rendered object.

Usage:

```bash
python example.py
```

By default, the example will render the `banana.obj` mesh in this directory, and output the result into a `results` folder in this directory.

Use the `--help` option to display available arguments.

The DIB-R renderer is based on its original implementation by Wenzheng et al.
