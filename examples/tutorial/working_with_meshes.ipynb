Version 0.15.0 added `gltf` importer, as well as support for `vertex_tangents` in the mesh. Version 0.16.0 introduced subtle changes that make data imported from all three formats consistent, and also added `kaolin.io.import_mesh` that calls appropriate method based on filename extension.\n",

For `obj`, set `raw_materials=False` to enable this option. The `SurfaceMesh` class can also now forward methods like `cuda()` to the contained materials. Additionally, subtle changes were made to `USD` importer, and `obj` importer now uses different convention for `Y` of the `UV` coordinates (set `uvs[...,1] = 1-uvs[...,1]` to restore old behavior.\n",

In addition, `materials` are now imported in name-sorted order and `material_order` has been replaced with `material_assignments` tensor of shape `(num_faces,)`, with integer value indicating the material index assigned to the corresponding face."
