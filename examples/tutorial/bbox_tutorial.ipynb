    "Differentiable rendering enables optimization of 3D object properties like the geometry of a mesh. Unlike traditional rendering, differentiable rendering can backpropagate gradients from image space to 3D geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we fit a 3D bounding box around an object given ground truth images of the object. We assume images come with a segmentation mask of the object of interest and include camera extrinsics. During fitting we optimize a 3D bounding box to fit tightly around the object, despite never seeing any 3D ground truth data.\n",

Please note this notebook is intended to illustrate key kaolin functionality and is not intended for use in a production system. A more sophisticated use of differentiable rendering can be found in the [Optimizing a mesh using a Differentiable Renderer notebook](examples/tutorial/dibr_tutorial.ipynb). Additional DIB-R examples can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/DIB-R-Single-Image-3D-Reconstruction).\n",

In 3D bounding box estimation our goal is to fit the 3D box around an object while keeping the box as some cuboid. To enforce this constraint we will take a fixed 3D cuboid and apply transformations that rotate, translate, or scale the box. Note that this constrains learning by preventing and shearing or other transformations that would deform the cuboid shape.\n",

The mesh is projected to the same 2D images based on the camera properties and the projected mesh silhouette is compared to the ground truth silhouette (segmentation mask). Losses are calculated by comparing the two silhouettes and a gradient step backpropagates the error through the mesh parameters (that is, the bounding box rotation, translation, and scaling from the initial mesh position)."
