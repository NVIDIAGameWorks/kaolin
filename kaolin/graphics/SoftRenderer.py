        NOTE: SoftRenderer works only in GPU mode!

        Args:
            image_size (int): Size of the (square) image to be rendered (default: 256).
            anti_aliasing (bool): Whether or not to perform anti-aliasing
                (default: True)
            bg_color (torch.Tensor): Background color of rendered image
                (size: math:`3`, default: :math:`\left[0, 0, 0\right]`)
            fill_back (bool): Whether or not to fill color to the back
                side of each triangle as well (sometimes helps, when
                the triangles in the mesh are not properly oriented.)
                (default: True)
            camera_mode (str): Choose from among `projection`, `look`, and
                `look_at`. In the `projection` mode, the camera is at the
                origin, and its optical axis is aligned with the positive
                Z-axis. In the `look_at` mode, the object (not the camera)
                is placed at the origin. The camera "looks at" the object
                from a predefined "eye" location, which is computed from
                the `viewing_angle` (another input to this function). In
                the `look` mode, only the direction in which the camera
                needs to look is specified. It does not necessarily look
                towards the origin, as it allows the specification of a
                custom "upwards" direction (default: 'look_at').
            K (torch.Tensor): Camera intrinsics matrix. Note that, unlike
                standard notation, K here is a 4 x 4 matrix (with the last
                row and last column drawn from the 4 x 4 identity matrix)
                (default: None)
            rmat (torch.Tensor): Rotation matrix (again, 4 x 4, as opposed
                to the usual 3 x 3 convention) (default: None).
            tvec (torch.Tensor): Translation vector (3 x 1). Note that the
                (negative of the) tranlation is applied before rotation,
                to be consistent with the projective geometry convention
                of transforming a 3D point X by doing
                torch.matmul(R.transpose(), X - t) (default: None).
            perspective_distort (bool): Whether or not to perform perspective
                distortion (to simulate field-of-view based distortion effects)
                (default: True).
            sigma_val (float): Sharpness of the probability distribution of each triangle
                (Refer to the paper for more details) (default: 1e-5).
            dist_func (str): Distance function to use (default: 'euclidean')
            dist_eps (float): A tiny positive number, for numerically stable distance
                computation (default: 1e-4).
            gamma_val (float): Sharpness parameter for the aggregation function (Refer to
                the paper for more details) (default: 1e-4).
            aggr_func_rgb (str): Aggregation function to use for the RGB channels
                (default: 'softmax').
            aggr_func_alpha (str): Aggregation function to use for the alpha channel
                (default: 'prod').
            texture_type (str): Type of textures to use ('surface' vs 'vertex')
                (default: 'surface').
            viewing_angle (float): Angle at which the object is to be viewed
                (assumed to be in degrees!) (default: 30.)
            viewing_scale (float): Scale at which the object is to be viewed
                (default: 1).
            eye (torch.Tensor): Location of the "eye" (of the camera). Used in the `look`
                and `look_at` modes (default: computed using `viewing_angle`).
            camera_direction (torch.Tensor): Direction in which the camera is facing
                (used only in the `look` and `look_at` modes) (default:
                :math:`[0, 0, 1]`)
            near (float): Near clipping plane (for depth values) (default: 1).
            far (float): Far clipping plane (for depth values) (default: 100).
            light_mode (str): Mode of lighting up the mesh (choices: 'surface', 'vertex')
                (default: 'surface').
            light_intensity_ambient (float): Intensity of ambient light (in the
                range :math:`\left[ 0, 1 \right]`) (default: 0.5).
            light_intensity_directional (float): Intensity of directional light
                (in the range :math:`\left[ 0, 1 \right]`) (default: 0.5).
            light_color_ambient (torch.Tensor): Color of ambient light
                (default: :math:`\left[ 1, 1, 1 \right]`)
            light_color_directional (torch.Tensor): Color of directional light
                (default: :math:`\left[ 1, 1, 1 \right]`)
            light_direction (torch.Tensor): Light direction, for directional
                light (default: :math:`\left[ 0, 1, 0 \right]`)
            device (torch.Tensor): Device on which all tensors are stored.
                NOTE: Although the default device is set to 'cpu', at the moment,
                rendering will work only if the device is CUDA enabled.
                Eg. 'cuda:0'.
