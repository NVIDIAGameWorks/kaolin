    This function implements a generalized smoothstep that creates a smooth transition

    derivatives at both endpoints, ensuring smooth transitions.

    """A generator function for returning continuous camera objects an on a smoothed path interpolated
    from a trajectory of cameras.

    The trajectory is assumed to have a list of at least 2 cameras, where the first and last cameras form a
    looped path. Certain interpolation modes (i.e. catmull_rom) may require additional cameras.
    If repeat is None, this generator is therefore never exhausted, and can be invoked infinitely to generate continuous
    camera motion. Otherwise the loop will repeat a finite number of times.

    Args:
        trajectory (List[kaolin.render.camera.Camera]):
            A trajectory of camera nodes, used to form a continuous path.
        frames_between_cameras (int): Number of interpolated points generated between each pair of cameras on the
            trajectory. In essence, this value controls how detailed, or smooth the path is.
        interpolation (str): Type of interpolation function used:
            'polynomial' uses a smoothstep polynomial function which tends to overshoot around the keyframes.
            This interpolator is fitting for paths orbiting an object of interest.
            'catmull_rom' uses a spline defined by 4 control points, guaranteed to pass precisely through the keyframes.
        repeat (int, Optional):
            If specified, will limit the number of loops. Passing None results in an infinite loop.

    Returns:
        (Iterator[kaolin.render.camera.Camera]):
            An interpolated camera object formed by the cameras trajectory.
