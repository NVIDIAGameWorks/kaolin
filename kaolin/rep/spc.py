class Spc(object):
    """Data class holding all :ref:`Structured Point Cloud (SPC)<spc>` information.

    This class supports batching through :ref:`packed<packed>` representation:
    a single Spc object can pack multiple SPC structures of variable sizes.

    SPC data structures are represented through the combination various tensors detailed below:

    ``octrees`` compress the information required to build a full SPC.
    In practice, they are a low level structure which also constitute the
    :ref:`core part<spc_octree>` of the SPC data structure.

    ``octrees`` are kept as a torch.ByteTensor, where each byte represents a single octree parent cell,
    and each bit represents the occupancy of a child octree cell.
    e.g: 8 bits for 8 cells.

    Bits describe the octree cells in Morton Order::

         . . . . . . . .
         | .   3  .  7  | .                    3   7
         |   . . . . . . . .           ===>    1   5
         |   | .   1  . | 5   .
         |   |   . . . . . . . .
         |   |    |     |       |              2   6
          . .|. . | . . .       |      ===>    0   4
            .| 2  |.  6   .     |
              . . | . . . . .   |
                . | 0  .  4   . |
                  . . . . . . . .

    If a cell is occupied, an additional cell byte may be generated in the next level,
    up till the argument ``level``.

    For example, a ``SPC.octrees`` field may, look as follows::

            tensor([255, 128,  64,  32,  16,   8,   4,   2,  23], dtype=torch.uint8)

    Here "octrees" represents an octree of 9 nodes.
    The binary representation should be interpreted as follows::

            Level #1, Path*,      11111111    (All cells are occupied, therefore 8 bytes are allocated for level 2)
            Level #2, Path*-1,    10000000
            Level #2, Path*-2,    01000000
            Level #2, Path*-3,    00100000
            Level #2, Path*-4,    00010000
            Level #2, Path*-5,    00001000
            Level #2, Path*-6,    00000100
            Level #2, Path*-7,    00000010
            Level #2, Path*-8,    00010111

    ``lengths`` is a tensor of integers required to support batching. Since we assume a packed representation,
    all octree cells are shaped as a single stacked 1D tensor. ``lengths`` specifies the number of cells (bytes) each
    octree uses.

    ``features`` represent an optional per-point feature vector.
    When ``features`` is not ``None``, a feature is kept for each point at the highest-resolution level in the octree.

    ``max_level`` is an integer which specifies how many recursive levels an octree should have.

    ``point_hierarchies``, ``pyramid``, ``exsum`` are auxilary structures, which are generated upon request and
    enable efficient indexing to SPC entries.

    `` parents`` provides an optional quick mapping between SPC cells and their parents.

    ``pyramids_dual``, ``point_hierarchies_dual``, ``trinkets`` are fields used to map between the SPC primary octree,
    which keeps features at cell centers, and an optional dual-octree, which keeps features at the 8 corners of each
    cell. The dual octree is only generated upon request (by accessing such fields).
