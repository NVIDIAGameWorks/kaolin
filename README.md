## Kaolin: A PyTorch Library for Accelerating 3D Deep Learning Research

**[Documentation](https://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** | **[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05063)**


Kaolin is a PyTorch library aiming to accelerate 3D deep learning research. Kaolin provides efficient implementations of differentiable 3D modules for use in deep learning systems. With functionality to load and preprocess several popular 3D datasets, and native functions to manipulate meshes, pointclouds, signed distance functions, and voxel grids, Kaolin mitigates the need to write wasteful boilerplate code. Kaolin packages together several differentiable graphics modules including rendering, lighting, shading, and view warping. Kaolin also supports an array of loss functions and evaluation metrics for seamless evaluation and provides visualization functionality to render the 3D results. Importantly, we curate a comprehensive model zoo comprising many state-of-the-art 3D deep learning architectures, to serve as a starting point for future research endeavours.

> *Fun fact*: The name _Kaolin_, itâ€™s from Kaolinite, a form of plasticine (clay) that is sometimes used in 3D modeling.

## Functionality

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/kaolin_applications.png">
</p>

Currently, the (beta) release contains several processing functions for 3D deep learning on meshes, voxels, signed distance functions, and pointclouds. Loading of several popular datasets (eg. ShapeNet, ModelNet, SHREC) are supported out-of-the-box. We also implement several 3D conversion and transformation operations (both within and across the aforementioned representations). 

Kaolin supports several 3D tasks such as:
* Differentiable rendering (see [Neural Mesh Renderer](https://github.com/hiroharu-kato/neural_renderer), its [PyTorch port](https://github.com/daniilidis-group/neural_renderer), [Soft Rasterizer](https://github.com/ShichenLiu/SoftRas), [Differentiable Interpolation-based Renderer](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/DIB-R/), and a modular and extensible abstract DifferentiableRenderer specification).
* Single-image based mesh reconstruction ([Pixel2Mesh](https://github.com/nywang16/Pixel2Mesh), [GEOMetrics](https://github.com/EdwardSmith1884/GEOMetrics), [OccupancyNets](https://github.com/autonomousvision/occupancy_networks), and more...)
* Pointcloud classification and segmentation ([PointNet](https://github.com/fxia22/pointnet.pytorch), [PoinNet++](https://github.com/erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch), [DGCNN](https://github.com/muhanzhang/pytorch_DGCNN), ...)
* Mesh classification and segmentation ([MeshCNN](https://github.com/ranahanocka/MeshCNN), [GCN](https://github.com/tkipf/pygcn))
* 3D superresolution on voxel grids ([ODM](https://github.com/EdwardSmith1884/Multi-View-Silhouette-and-Depth-Decomposition-for-High-Resolution-3D-Object-Representation), VoxelUNet, and more...)
* Basic graphics utilities (lighting, shading, etc.)

## Model Zoo

Kaolin curates a large _model zoo_ containing reference implementations of popular 3D DL architectures. Head over [here](kaolin/models) to check them out.

> *NOTE*: For several of these models, the implementation is due to the original authors. We build a bridge to our library and wherever possible, we introduce optimization. If you use any of the models in the model zoo, or the graphics packages (eg. differentiable renderers such as [NMR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07566), [SoftRas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01786), [DIB-R](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01210)), please cite the original papers in addition to Kaolin. For convenience, BibTeX citation formats for each of the original papers are included in the documentation for each model provided.


## Installation and Usage

> **NOTE**: The API is currently somewhat unstable, as we're making constant changes. (It's a beta release)

### Requirements
- Linux
- Python >= 3.6
- CUDA >= 10.0.130 (with `nvcc` installed)
- Display Driver >= 410.48

Windows support is in the works and is currently considered experimental.

### Dependencies
- numpy >= 1.17
- PyTorch >= 1.2 and Torchvision (see [pytorch.org](http://pytorch.org) for installation instructions)

### Installation

We highly recommend installing Kaolin inside of a virtual environment (such as ones created using `conda` or `virtualenv`). In this example, we show how to create a `conda` virtual environment for installing kaolin.
```sh
$ conda create --name kaolin python=3.6
$ conda activate kaolin
```

#### Dependencies
Install PyTorch and Torchvision by following instructions from https://pytorch.org/. Numpy will be installed as part of the Pytorch installation. Note that the setup file does not automatically install these dependencies.

#### Install Kaolin
Now, you can install the library. From the root directory of this repo (i.e., the directory containing this `README` file), run

##### For General Use
```sh
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace   # optional, allows importing kaolin from the kaolin root directory
$ python setup.py install
```

##### For Development (modifying kaolin code)
```sh
$ python setup.py develop
```
Note, if modifying or adding Cython files, ensure that Cython is installed and set the following environment variable `USE_CYTHON=1`.

During installation, the *packman* package manager will 
download the nv-usd package to `~/packman-repo/` containing the necessary packages for reading and writing Universal Scene Description (USD) files. 

Note, if you are using an heterogeneous GPUs setup set the architectures for which you want to compile the cuda code using the environment variable.

Example:
```sh
$ export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="7.0 7.5"
```

### Verify installation

To verify that `kaolin` has been installed, fire up your python interpreter, and execute the following commands.

```python
>>> import kaolin as kal
>>> print(kal.__version__)
```

### Building the Documentation

To delve deeper into the library, build the documentation. From the root directory of the repository (i.e., the directory containing this `README` file), execute the following.

```bash
$ cd docs
$ sphinx-build . _build
```

### Running Unittests

To run unittests, from the root directory of the repository (i.e., the directory containing this `README` file), execute the following commands.

```bash
$ pytest tests/
```
